**PDIS (Plant Disease Identification System)** is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload images of plant leaves and get real-time disease analysis, diagnosis, and treatment suggestions using deep learning and LLMs.

# Model Training
subheader("Model Training")
st.markdown("""
The disease detection model was trained using the [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/) from Kaggle, which includes over 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.

##### :grey[**Training Highlights:**]
- **Dataset**: Multi-class folder structure
- **Augmentation**: Resize, horizontal flip, rotation, normalization
- **Model**: Pretrained ResNet-50
- **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Optimizer**: Adam

```python
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

model.fc = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 1024),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),
    nn.Linear(1024, num_classes)
)
```

##### :grey[**Steps for Training:**]

1. Data Preparation
    * Images are organized in folders by class.
    * Data is augmented with resizing, random flips, and rotations.
    * Images are normalized to match pretrained model expectations.

2. Model Setup
    * A ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet is used.
    * All original layers are frozen to retain learned features.
    * The final classification layer is replaced to match the number of target classes.

3. Training Configuration
    * Only the new classifier head is trained; the rest of the model remains unchanged.
    * Cross-entropy loss is used for multi-class classification.
    * The Adam optimizer updates the classifier's weights.

4. Data Preparation
    * The model is trained for a set number of epochs.
    * For each batch:
        * Images and labels are loaded and processed.
        * The model predicts class probabilities.
        * Loss and accuracy are calculated.
        * The classifier's weights are updated based on the loss.
    * After each epoch, overall training loss and accuracy are reported.
